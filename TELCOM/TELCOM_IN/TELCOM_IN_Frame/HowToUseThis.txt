Hello!
You want to use telcom to receive telegrams? OK! Please follow next marks.

1. To generate 'Telcom_In.xls' you can do it by hand or using macro 'CreateTelcomInOut.xla' from folder 'Macros'.
   In first step in 'Telcom_In.xls' all sheets after sheet 5 will be deleted to let modul, header and PlantFieldType definitions.
   PlantFieldType may not used in all interfaces therefor could be deleted before or after generation by hand.
   'CreateTelcomInOut.xla' macro reads excel files defined in 'UsedInterfaces.txt' from current directory. 
   This means that 'UsedInterfaces.txt' is project depended and has to be adapted. In files from 'UsedInterfaces.txt' 
   are telegram-definitions which will be copied to 'Telcom_In.xls' started with sheet number 4 (to avoid copying modul and header definitions) till end.
   All interface definitions are in '\SMC\doc\External_Communication\ExcelDefinitions\'

2. Generation of telcom-specific code will be done by custom build step during compilation of this package.
   For this step an environment variable must be set to be able to open excel.
   For example MSOFFICE_DIR := C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office10
