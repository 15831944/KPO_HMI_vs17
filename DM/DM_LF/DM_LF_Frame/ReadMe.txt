========================================================================

AppWizard has created this DM_LF_Frame library project for you. 
No source files were created as part of your project.


DM_LF_Frame.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.

This project was created via the Model Assistant of Rational Rose.

The event handling part of this project should scrutinized carefully, cause there is still
some ambiguities.
