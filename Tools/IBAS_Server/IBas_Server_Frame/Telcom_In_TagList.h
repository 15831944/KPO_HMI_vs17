// ATTENTION:
// The Tag List generation works only if the Telegrams
// do not contain data structures that are more complex than
// arrays of the built-in data types. In particular,
// USER-DEFINED TYPES and RECORDS ARE CURRENTLY NOT HANDLED.
// For BAS-Communication, this limitation is not too serious,
// and for the other interfaces (e.g. L3, Mill), usage of this
// tagged data ccess method is not foreseen at this time.
